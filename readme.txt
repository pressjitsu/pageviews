A simple and lightweight pageviews counter for your WordPress posts and pages.

== Description ==

Pageviews is a simple and lightweight views counter for your WordPress posts and pages. It is based on JavaScript and is compatible with all caching plugins, proxies and complex setups. Pageviews works with a hosted processing service, and performs extremely well under high-traffic and on sites with large amounts of content.

**Don't start from scratch!** Import existing numbers from Google Analytics and other services with [Pageviews Sync](https://pageviews.io/sync/).

= Features =

* Display the number of times a post or page has been viewed
* Works on high-traffic websites with zero impact on performance
* Includes useful hooks and APIs for seamless integration into third-party themes
* Compatible with caching plugins, proxies and application firewalls

More information on [Pageviews.io](https://pageviews.io).

If you need any setup assistance or help migrating your existing views counts from other plugins or services please reach out to us [via e-mail](https://pageviews.io/contact/), or open a new thread in the WordPress.org support forums. For best performance Pageviews uses an external service to collect and process numbers.
